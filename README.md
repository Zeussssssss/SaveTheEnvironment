# EnvironmentGradient
Submission for HackMIT'22

EnvironmentGradient is a web application which aims to show the affect of different types of pollution on animals populations in the United States. It leverages the Google Maps API to generate a map which has color-coordinated heat maps of animal populations and pollution over time. Users can choose to show different pollution types and animal types on the map, respectively. The overlap of specific types of pollution with animal populations can be visualized.

Submission notes: We were unable to get the heat map to display on the web application. However, we performed data analysis on data from epa.gov on air pollution and animal population data from fwy.gov. The were able to associate latitude and longitude values with regional animal populations. Moreover, we were able to associate air quality index values with specific latitude and longitude values. In the future, we would like to add real-time data scraping to monitor pollution indexes and animal populations in real-time.
